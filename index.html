                    <p>My name is Kyle Doerksen, and currently I am a second-year student in the Computer Systems Technology course at Saskatchewan Polytechnic. Growing up, I always loved computers so much that I spent most of my childhood on them. During my high school career, I took a few computer science classes to fulfill my science credits and quickly discovered my passion for programming. Following my graduation, I enrolled in the CST program with the hopes of learning more about programming and the tech industry as a whole. Throughout my time in CST, I've come to realize that I have a passion for development - whether it's software, web applications, or even mobile applications, I always enjoy and put my best foot forward when working on these projects. I believe my greatest traits are my passion for learning and my problem-solving ability. This site showcases a few of my projects from both solo and group work. Feel free to check out my GitHub page to look more in-depth into the code.</p>

                    <p>This project is a tournament manager for hockey tournament, and it was created for my projects class with a team of six of my classmates. The requirements were given to us as a mock proposal. We used Java, JavaFX, and sql. We had five weeks to work on it before presentations. Throughout the projects course we had frequent client interviews with an instructor acting as the client where we would have ask and answer questions, show our current progress, as well as have to prepare itineraries/meeting agendas. I learned a lot about effectively communicating with group members, pair programing, which gave me a chance to learn how to be an effective co-pilot, and I made a lot of diagrams. The biggest piece of functionality that I was tasked with creating was a drag and drop feature to interact with another piece of functionality that was being created at the same time by another pair. Overall this project was a great introduction to industry work and I learned a lot about the development process.</p>

                    <p>This project is a customer tracker created solo for my advanced mobile development course. I made it using Zamarin, mostly c#, and sqlite. Within the application you can create users and interactions they had with certain products. The challenge of this project was understanding how to properly bind properties to objects on the screen and update them dynamically. The application had five pages, first was the home screen which displays all saved customers, then there's the add customer page with form inputs, there's an interactions page which is accessed by selecting a customer on the home screen, there's the products page which shows what products are in the database, lastly there's a settings page where there is a button to reset the database to default settings. During this project I learned a lot about Zamarin as well as using sqlite with an android application.</p>

                    <p>This program is an android game I made for my mobile development course. It was for my final project where we were asked to write a proposal for what we wanted to build, that also met the instructors requirements. I ended up writing my proposal for an infinite runner where you jump over enemies to get points. I also included a local leader board, custom sprite animation, and a notification system. The bigger challenges of this project were the animations as it was a new concept for me, and creating the notification system as it was time-consuming to test. What I learned most from this project was how much I enjoyed making games, as well as how to do sprite work in android studios.</p>

                    <p>I won this award for a joint group project for my communications course and hardware course. The project was to write a proposal for a fleet of a few hundred desktop computers. My classmates and I were separated us into teams of six, and told that the group with the best proposal gets an award. Our job was to read the hardware requirements and come up with the parts, reasons for the parts, and prices. My team was very balanced and all great with communication, so we split everything up and got our parts done while helping each other where we could. The most challenging aspect of the project were understanding the hardware requirements. I learned a lot about the importance of team work, and communication as all the different parts of the proposal were intertwined in one way or another.</p>

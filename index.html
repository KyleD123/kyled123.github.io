                    <p>My name is Kyle Doerksen, and currently I am looking for work in the video game industry. 
                        <!-- a second-year student in the Computer Systems Technology course at Saskatchewan Polytechnic.  -->
                        Growing up, I spent a lot of my time playing video games. During my high school career, 
                        I took a few computer science classes to fulfill my science credits and quickly discovered my passion for programming. 
                        Following my graduation, I enrolled in the Computer Systems Technology (CST) program with the hopes of learning more about programming 
                        and the tech industry as a whole. 
                        After receiving my certificate, I spent a year working for Saskpolytech's 
                        applied research department known as Digital Integration Centre of Excellence (DICE).
                        I was put on a small team and worked on developing the A.I. for our client's upcoming release.
                        During my time on this project I discoverd my passion for Unity development. While contracted at DICE, I would spend my free time
                        competing in game jams and practicing Unity development. Now that my contract is up, I plan on seeking more opportunities in the video game industry.
                        I always enjoy and put my best foot forward when working on any project. I believe my greatest traits are my passion 
                        for learning and my problem-solving ability. This site showcases a few of my projects from both solo and group work. Feel free to check out my 
                        GitHub page to look more in-depth into the code.</p>

                            This project is a game created for the Saskatoon Game Jam, by SaskInteractive. 
                            It was created using the Unity Engine with the art done in Aseprite. Wild Waves 
                            is top-down wave shooter game with the goal of surviving as long as you can. 
                            It was a simple game created by my partner and I; I was the game developer/designer,
                            while my partner worked as the artist/editor. 
                            The rule of the game jam was to finish a game within 48 hours. 
                            The theme of this game jam was 'Make it count'. To fit the theme
                            I designed the game such that the player only has enough bullets for each wave of enemies; requiring the player
                            to make their shots count.
                            This was my third experience building a game from 
                            scratch, but I worked efficiently on designing and developing game mechanics, while helping come up with ideas and feedback for my partners assets. 
                            A few important skills I worked on during this game jam was rapid prototyping and polishing.
                            Wild Waves won the best art award category, and was runner up for the best itch.io game page.

                        <p>This project is a game created for the Nokia 3310 Jam 6; a game jam with restrictions related to the capabilities of the Nokia 3310 phone.
                            With a team of two developers and one artist, we created Paraline within the one week time limit. The tools used for the project were Unity
                            and Aseprite. Paraline is a side scrolling infinite runner, where you try to drive as far as you can while stopping for stop signs. 
                            Throughout the creation of Paraline, the team had to quickly come up with game mechancics while keeping the scope to a something
                            managable to finish before the deadline. In the early days of the jam the majority of my work was designing/implementing the mechanics of the game,
                            while helping with ideas and feedback for the artist. Halfway through the jam, the second developer on the team joined. I had spent some time catching
                            up the second dev, while also getting feedback from them. We finished the game a few hours before the deadline to give us time to create the itch.io page.
                            What I learned most in this project was team management and working within more restrictive project constraints.

                    <p>This program is an android game I made for my mobile development course. It was for my final project where we were asked to write a proposal for what we wanted to build, that also met the instructors requirements. I ended up writing my proposal for an infinite runner where you jump over enemies to get points. I also included a local leader board, custom sprite animation, and a notification system. The bigger challenges of this project were the animations as it was a new concept for me, and creating the notification system as it was time-consuming to test. What I learned most from this project was how much I enjoyed making games, as well as how to do sprite work in android studios.</p>

                    <p>I won this award for a joint group project for my communications course and hardware course. The project was to write a proposal for a fleet of a few hundred desktop computers. My classmates and I were separated us into teams of six, and told that the group with the best proposal gets an award. Our job was to read the hardware requirements and come up with the parts, reasons for the parts, and prices. My team was very balanced and all great with communication, so we split everything up and got our parts done while helping each other where we could. The most challenging aspect of the project were understanding the hardware requirements. I learned a lot about the importance of team work, and communication as all the different parts of the proposal were intertwined in one way or another.</p>
